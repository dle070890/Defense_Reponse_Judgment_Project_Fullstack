There might be a brute force in SSH against your network. This will give you the alert rules and drop rules against SSH brute force-----------------------------------------------------------------------------BLEEDING-EDGE POTENTIAL SSH SCAN[1] This alert rule tells snort to generate when it detects a TCP SSH protocol dictionary attacks against your network. This rule check packets for TCP protocol from external source to internal source receive any traffic from port 22. The packet header have a SYN flag, which is identified by flags:S, and captured 20 times during a 120 seconds period from the same source address.
